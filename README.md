# sylixdevkahoot

just copy raw file, paste in kahoot console.
but you need game id [not code] the hosting id. [example] : "2984566e-81f5-4f3f-82e6-bdfa93e673ee"

# way to simply find the host id would be looking at the host's screen, and looking at the url. 
# or, finding the exact kahoot game on the hosting web, so you would make an account/login and try finding it
